### poly-algebra
`Poly-algebra` is a library that contains typeclass abstractions for common algebraic structures. Implicits, specialization
and macros are used extensively to create an elegant API with virtually no performance cost.

 - New in 0.2.1: Concatenative structures up to `ConcatenativeMonad` that abstracts over `filter`
 - New in 0.2.0: Macros for inlining implicit operators
