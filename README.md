## poly-algebra [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ctongfei/poly-algebra.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ctongfei/poly-algebra)

This is my own experiments with Scala typeclasses. 

`Poly-algebra` is a library that contains a hierarchy of typeclass abstractions for common algebraic structures and 
higher-kinded functional constructs that enables generic math programming in Scala.
Implicits, specialization and macros are used extensively to create an elegant API with virtually no performance cost.

#### Installation
```scala
libraryDependencies += "me.tongfei" %% "poly-algebra" % "0.4.0"
```
